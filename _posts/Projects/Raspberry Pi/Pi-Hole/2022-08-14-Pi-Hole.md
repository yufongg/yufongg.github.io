# Overview
After the [evil-twin](https://yufongg.github.io/posts/evil-twin/) project, I continued to root machines on hackthebox/vulnhub and left my raspberry pi to collect dust, recently I randomly thought of my raspberry pi and wanted to put my raspberry pi to its full use again! 

During my research for my Wi-Fi pentesting project, I stumbled upon pi-hole raspberry pi projects, at that point I thought that it could be really useful for me as I am unable to block ads on my phone/tv, however since it is not related to my project scope, I had to find another project. But now, I can finally try it out! 


# Prerequisite Tools
- [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
- [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

# Pi-Hole Setup
## OS Installation
1. Select `Raspberry Pi OS`
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220813222530.png)
2. Select Settings at `Bottom Right`, 
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220813222603.png)
3. Enable SSH, set username & password
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220813222645.png)
4. Eject SSD
5. Plug SSD into Pi
6. Connect ethernet cable 
7. Power on the Pi


## Configure Static IP address for your Pi
1. Login to your Router's web interface
	- `http://192.168.1.1`
	- `http://192.168.1.254`.
2. View local device to find out Pi's assigned IP address
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220814022541.png)
3. SSH w/ your configured credentials
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220814022636.png)
4. View currently defined router
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220814022849.png)
	- routers: `192.168.1.254`
5. View current DNS Server
	```
	sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
	```
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220813233053.png)
	- nameserver: `192.168.1.254`
6. Modify `dhcpcd.conf` to configure our static IP address for your Pi
	```
	interface <NETWORK>                     
	static ip_address=<STATICIP>/24
	static routers=<ROUTERIP>
	static domain_name_servers=<DNSIP>

	<NETWORK>:  wlan0(wireless)/eth0(wired)
	<STATICIP>: IP Address in the Upper Numbers of your DHCP range [Recommendation]
	<routers>:  Refer to Step 4
	<DNSIP>:    Refer to step 5
	```
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220814023243.png)
	- Save the file `CTRL + X` then `Y`, followed by `ENTER`
7. Reboot
	```
	sudo reboot
	```

## Pi-Hole Installation
1. Proceed to your SSH w/ your configured credentials
2.  [Install Pi-Hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/#curl--ssl-httpsinstallpi-holenet--bash) (one-liner)
	```
	curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
	```
3. Use the following settings
	1. `YES` - Set static IP using current values
	2. Choose your DNS Provider
	3. Select 3rd party list, just go with the suggested list
	4. `On` - web admin interface
	5. `On` - web server (lighttpd)
	6. `On` - Log queries
	7. `0` - Show everything
	8. Done

4. Add additional blocklist
	1. Login to `http://<Pi IP address>/admin`
	2. Proceed to `Group Management` > `Adlists`
	3. Proceed to [firebog](https://firebog.net), copy links that are highlighted in green
		![](Pasted%20image%2020220814025452.png)
	4. Paste them in `Address`, under `Add new adlist`
		![](Pasted%20image%2020220814025548.png)
	5. Click online to update your gravity list, and you're done!


## DNS Server
1. If you have the option to set your DNS Server on your router, change it to your Pi's IP Address
	- Unfortunately my router does not allow me to do so, so I will have to manually set the DNS Server of my devices


## Results
- Youtube:
	- Unfortunately, due to how youtube ads works, it does not work for youtube.
- Streaming sites, it works really well!
	- For e.g., when you click on the play button, an ad pops up and forces you to open another tab and sometimes even redirects you to another application!
	- Or there are so many ads that you cannot even see the panels/video.
